created the GameSurfaceView and decided I was going to implement the game by touch since buttons would have been
clunky and hardcoded

started by drawing a single square using the drawRect function

created the Square class so each square has an int value

made the array of Squares and spaced them, had a couple issues trying to space them properly,
playing around with the spacing and drawing of rectangles allowed me to fix this

decided to make the Square class as minimalist as possible, initially had it store a
Paint type, but decided that it was going to color it depending on the number value
this is why the highest value of the game is assigned as the "empty spot"

had issues with my taps not being detected, forgot to hook up the onClickListener in MainActivity

assigned text to each of the boxes using drawText.

for detecting if an empty space was around the tapped box, I was having issues where it wouldn't move.
fixed by playing around with the if functions

generated an equation to check if the square was in the correct position
